      The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is
      7 March 1916, when an aircraft producer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke
      (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik) was established.[1][2] This company
      was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the BMW
      name dates back to 1917, when Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to
      Bayerische Motoren Werke.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six
      aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW
      remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment,
      household items and railway brakes.
